title: We cannot hold the elections now. Cancel the elections.
subtitle: This is an anti-democratic move that may backfire.
view-if: in_emergency_government == 1 and president == "Braun" and not presidential_powers

Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

Fine. President [+ president +] has taken the unprecedented step of canceling these elections. New elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

Let us hope this does not backfire.

The constitutional bourgeois parties have enough votes to form a coalition on their own, without even needing toleration from us. It is likely that such a government will be formed unless we act to prevent it.

President Braun faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so?

Through their violent electioneering, the Nazis have, together with the DNVP, won a majority. But it is not enough, and Hitler desires total and absolute power. To this end, he has proposed an act - the "Enabling Act" - that would give him and his cabinet legislative powers, bypassing the Reichstag entirely. To pass, it requires a 2/3rds majority vote, though the KPD's deputies are under arrest, preventing them from voting against, as are our own deputies on the party's left-wing.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

With our victory in the civil war, the Communists have found the confidence to directly participate in government. They have dropped their abstentionist approach, and will take any ministry which we do not.

Having successfully cobbled together an odd mismatch across the political spectrum, Schleicher has won the vote of no confidence against him pushed by the energetic KPD. With the political machine of the DNE behind him, Hindenburg's trust, and the tenuous support of the Reichswehr, Schleicher's future is secure. Hitler has lost, but at what cost?

There is no path to a majority government. President Marx is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz Bracht as chancellor instead of BrÃ¼ning, hoping that Bracht would be able to form a coalition, or at least receive toleration, from the NSDAP. Bracht is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Bracht is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence. [+ bracht_r +]% vote in support of his government.

@schleicher_second_try

After the election, there is still no clear majority. Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher claims to have a plan to save Germany, and he has reached out to the Social Democrats with vague promises. He claims that in order to govern, the Reichstag must be temporarily suspended to prevent the Nazis and Communists from disrupting government, in effect giving him and Hindenburg dictatorial powers.

[? if works_program <= 0: The trade unions are somewhat favorable to Schleicher's plan, as they see a commonality between Schleicher's economic plan and the ADGB's WTB-plan for debt-funded job creation. However, the rest of our party is vehemently against Schleicher. ?]

Rumors are that Schleicher is also reaching out to the Nazis with similar promises of cooperation; he seems to believe that he can "tame" the Nazis. Most in our party do not trust him to not bring the Nazis to power. In addition, working with him would essentially mean the end of our claim to be a "democratic" party.

There are enough votes to form a right-wing coalition of the Z, DVP, DNVP, and various minor parties, essentially replicating the previous Marx government. However, the DNVP is very reluctant to join the government[? if year <= 1928 : , as it had just exited from a coalition with the Center. ?][? if year > 1928 : , as its leader, Alfred Hugenberg, is against the very existence of parliamentary democracy, and is unwilling to join such a coalition anymore. ?]

Chancellor Heinrich BrÃ¼ning of the Center Party currently rules on an emergency basis, as part of a "presidential government". New elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous chancellor has resigned, and has been replaced by Heinrich BrÃ¼ning, also of the Center Party, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.

We can pick from any number of ministries. Controlling a ministry allows us to directly effect policy in that area.

With Gustav Stresemann as the main member of the DVP advocating a Grand Coalition with the SPD in the first place, under the expectation of being made foreign minister, our push for the ministry has caught him completely by surprise. The DVP has refused to cede the foreign ministry.
